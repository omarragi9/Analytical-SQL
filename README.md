Online Retail Analytics (Analytical-SQL project)
==================================================

## Description:

This repository contains SQL queries designed to analyze the OnlineRetail dataset. The dataset encompasses sales transactions in an online retail store, providing insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.

## Table of Contents:

### 1. Introduction:

The OnlineRetail dataset is an invaluable resource for understanding customer preferences and sales patterns in an online retail environment. This repository offers a comprehensive set of SQL queries aimed at extracting meaningful insights from the data.

### 2. Queries Overview:


The SQL queries are structured to address various aspects of the dataset, enabling users to derive actionable insights. Here's a brief overview of the queries included:

**Total Sales Analysis:** Calculates the total sales revenue generated by all transactions.

**Customer Sales Ranking:** Identifies top-spending customers based on their total purchase amount.

**Product Performance:** Determines the most profitable items by calculating the sum of sales for each product.

**Yearly and Monthly Sales:** Analyzes sales trends over different time periods, both annually and monthly.

**Average Items per Invoice:** Computes the average number of items per invoice, providing insights into purchase behavior.

**Customer Purchase Behavior:** Evaluates the average profit and quantity of items purchased by each customer.

**Monthly Sales Variations:** Measures the monthly difference in sales revenue to identify trends and anomalies.

### 3. Monetary Model Implementation:


This section implements a monetary model to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Customers are classified into distinct groups such as Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, etc., based on their recency, frequency, and monetary values.

### 4. Daily Purchasing Transaction Analysis:

This part of the project addresses two questions related to customer purchasing behavior:

**Maximum Consecutive Purchase Days:** Determines the maximum number of consecutive days a customer makes purchases.

**Average Days to Reach Spending Threshold:** Calculates the average number of days or transactions required for a customer to reach a spending threshold of 250 L.E.

## Usage:

To use the SQL queries, simply execute them in a compatible SQL environment such as Toad, with the OnlineRetail dataset imported.
